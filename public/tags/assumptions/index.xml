      <description>OK, although I’m trained as a civil lawyer, I’m certainly no learned doctor of the Canon Law of the Catholic Church. For that reason, I’m going to be taking at face value many statements published by ostensibly authoritative sources concerning Church teachings regarding questions of Papal Primacy and LGTG issues, which the Church often describes as “homosexuality.” I discuss what appear to be the principal statements that would have to be walked back and how those might present problems with inconsistencies with related areas.</description>

      <description>Is the glass half-full or half-empty?
Both, of course. Why ask?
If drinking the cup of hemlock then it’s still half-empty. If partying down, then it’s half-empty already. If taking a pre-exam purgative, it’s only half empty.
If pouring champers, and much of the glass is bubbles, it’s only half-full. If only a mile from the oasis, it is still half-full.

      <description>Truth must change her fashion
 It is not too much to say that no formula which expresses clearly the thought of one generation, can convey the same meaning to the generation which follows.
