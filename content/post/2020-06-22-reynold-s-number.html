<blockquote>
<p>I have no quarrel with time.<br />
I float, flow, will sink, not sync.<br />
Time herself has the indifference<br />
Of a schoolboyâ€™s secret crush,<br />
We stand invisible in suspense<br />
That perhaps the usual rules<br />
Will be suspended, in our case,<br />
And the surprise will be more time,<br />
Time long after we weary of it<br />
As we wearied of childhood and<br />
Its fabled happiness of endless<br />
August cut off from recess.</p>
</blockquote>
