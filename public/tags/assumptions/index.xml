      <description>Is the glass half-full or half-empty?
Both, of course. Why ask?
If drinking the cup of hemlock then it’s still half-empty. If partying down, then it’s half-empty already. If taking a pre-exam purgative, it’s only half empty.
If pouring champers, and much of the glass is bubbles, it’s only half-full. If only a mile from the oasis, it is still half-full.
