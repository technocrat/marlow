      <description>So, one summer I was camped in Sequoia National Park in Californiaâ€™s Sierra Nevada mountains. My buddy had hiked out to get his sore bottom treated and I was enjoying Don Quijote, walking six miles upstream to a ford on the Kern River and cross over to soak in the hot springs under Mt. Whitney.
It was an unusually quiet year in the Kern Canyon. A deeper-than-usual snowpack was still blocking the easy passes in early July.</description>
