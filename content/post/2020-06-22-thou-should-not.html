<ul>
<li>Don’t listen to the voice that says go for it!</li>
<li>Don’t ignore the voice that says you’ll be sorry</li>
<li>Don’t focus on your failures, you can always find new ways of screwing up</li>
<li>Don’t expect it to be different this time</li>
<li>Don’t worry about tomorrow, you’ll know it when it comes</li>
</ul>
