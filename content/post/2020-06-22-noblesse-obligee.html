<blockquote>
<p>It is only in the middle classes, Stephen, that people get into a state of dumb helpless horror when they find that there are wicked people in the world. In our class, we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people; and nothing should disturb our self possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Britomart, <em>Major Barbara</em> by G.B. Shaw</p>
